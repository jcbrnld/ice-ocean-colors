Ice/Ocean colormaps 

These were originally designed to show spatial plots of sea ice properties as their names reflect. 
They are, however,  useful for many other color mapping applications.

Some of these maps are near perceptually uniform (intensity changes nearly linearly), but perceptual
uniformity was not the goal. Rather the goal was to create colormaps that allow visual distinguishment of
many neighboring colors. Also of priority was for divergent colormap high and low extremes to be 
distinguishable, an issue found in many other divergent colormaps.   


iointerp returns a specified number of color bins for plotting non-continuous colorbars. 
iointerp also allows the specification of specific colors to use in the top and bottom bins.
This is unsful when you wish to distinguish end members more clearly.
